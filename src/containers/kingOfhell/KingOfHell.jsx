        Defeated the vice of the strongest Yonko in One Piece and was crowned himself as the King of Hell.
        </h1>
        <p>In the Battle of Onigashima on Wano Island, Roronoa Zoro fought a fierce battle against King, Kaido's right-hand man and one of the strongest captains of the Beast Pirates. Zoro used his Armament Haki and Tri-Sword Techniques to enhance his attacks and withstand King's immense power, which was based on the Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit. During the fight, Zoro was able to unleash his latent potential and use his Haki, allowing him to execute a finishing move with the "Hell King: Tri-Sword Onigiri" technique, defeating King and declaring himself the "Hell King".</p>
        <h4>This victory cemented Zoro's status as one of the strongest fighters in the story.</h4>
